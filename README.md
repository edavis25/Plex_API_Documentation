OpenAPI specification for the Plex web API.

#### Dsecription
This project is an attempt at documenting some of the many API endpoints used by the Plex web application. Since Plex is closed-source and does not publically expose documentation for their API, this project attempts to document the API's functionality using the OpenAPI specification.

This project was inspired by Marc Stephenson's [Unofficial Plex API Documentation](https://github.com/Arcanemagus/plex-api). His documentation is another excellent
resource that I highly recommend when learning how to consume the Plex API.
